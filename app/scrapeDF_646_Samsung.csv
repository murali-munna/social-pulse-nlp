993,Samsung Samsung,Reddit,"Yes, I upgraded about December from S10+ to Note 20 Ultra. I thought I would like using the pen since I have big fingers and I am old. I didn't like that the pen operates like a laser. You can see a constant laser point right before the pen touches the screen. I found it so annoying that I never used the pen.

So I thought maybe I should upgrade to S22U which I did. Same issue. AND I sacrificed the storage slot. I shoot a lot of photos and videos and the extra storage is important to me.

But finally I sent the S22U back within the return period, and purchased the S22+ which I am now using. I downgraded for the reasons above, but mainly, after 5 months I could not get used to the size and weight of the Note 20U, or the S22U. The S22+ is closer to the size of the S10+, just a little wider and slightly heavier. 

What I gave up.... The S22+ only can be ordered in max 256gb capacity. And no storage slot. I hope to keep it a year and maybe Samsung will create a model I like better next year. S10+ size, with Pen, and slot for storage and 512gb capacity, would be my druthers.",2022-05-25T00:25:54,,1,,negative

1012,Samsung SamsungGalaxy,Reddit,"As someone who had 2 pixel 6 pros and a girlfriend who has had hers since launch and is currently selling it, I do not recommend the pixel 6 or 6 pro at all. I can leave a laundry list of reasons if you want from my personal experience and from my girls experience. 

My brother has the s21 ultra and it's really good. The s22 ultra has upgrades in the boxier screen (if you prefer that), much much better cameras especially in HDR and night conditions, a brighter screen (matters to me since I'm outside a lot), and the s pen if you consider that an upgrade. The s22 ultra also feels a lot smoother than my brothers s21 ultra despite both of us running on the same software update. My brothers s21 ultra also gets warm and sometimes hot when he's recording videos or playing games, especially when we're outside. Aside from that, they're basically the same. 

I'd say since Samsung cucked us and got rid of the SD card slot, 512gb is better. If you're gonna record or take pictures, you're gonna seriously need the extra space. Videos and movies and songs are obviously situational on your end. Also the system files with the 512gb version isn't as compressed meaning theoretically, things should actually load a bit faster systemwide since the files have more space and don't have to be as compressed.

So basically I 100% recommend the 512gb variant of the phone but the s21 ultra vs s22 is purely up to you. If you have any questions at all, let me know",2022-05-11T19:42:47,,2,,negative

And it's got Snapdragon 855 and is well under budget.

Second option is obviously the S10+, but I think the side fingerprint sensor on the S10e is probably better than the under-display sensor. Bigger screen and 1440p means battery life is probably near the S10e despite the bigger battery.

Samsung does have some pretty cool exclusive features but so does OnePlus (fewer though), OnePlus however has been merging OPPO's OS with OxygenOS which they recently said that they're gonna reverse that and go back to keep them separate. Camera wise the OnePlus 9 Pro trades blows with the S21 Ultra so there is no doubt that it's better than the base S21. IMO the OnePlus does have some serious edge on charging speed since they promise to keep the battery at 80% after just as many charge cicles as Samsung while charging at 65W wired and 50 Wireless.

I'd stay away from anything Motorola, because Motorola is bad at software updates.

GSM Arena's comparison between the two is: ""The recently launched Galaxy A52s by Samsung runs on the same Snapdragon 778G 5G SoC and offers a large 120Hz Super AMOLED screen. Its quad-camera omits a zoom snapper, but the 64MP primary has OIS, which helps a lot at night. The Galaxy A52s is fully water-resistant, packs two loudspeakers, an under-display fingerprint scanner; then there are rarities like a 3.5mm jack and a microSD slot. If only the A52s had DeX support, it would have been the better choice. Alas, it doesn't, so once again, it's up to you to weigh on the pros and cons.""",2022-05-22T07:32:36,,3,,negative
1121,Samsung PickAnAndroidForMe,Reddit,"I have used low end Samsung phones for quite some time before switching to the S22 Ultra. You have listed easy battery replacement. Let me tell you, S5 was the last phone which had an open able back cover (not sure about the note series). All the new phones, throughout the range are now sealed. So battery replacement would be an issue, especially since it would affect water resistance as well. Talking about the low end phones, I don't know what kind of complaints you have heard, but both my low end phones worked perfectly fine till now. The only issue is that Samsung's own exynos processor is absolutely shit, and it works even worse in lower end phones. Don't get me wrong, they get the job done, but the lowered processing speeds over time might bother you. Going with the latest S series would be beneficial coz of the security patches and Android updates and stuff. Phones like M series are now equipped with Qualcom processors as well so that can be considered as well. Whatever phone you end up selecting tho, make sure to turn on battery protection from the settings, which restricts maximum charging to 85%, therefore enhancing battery life.",2022-05-25T23:08:56,,3,,negative

1123,Samsung PickAnAndroidForMe,Reddit,"Your plan has a glaring flaw.

Batteries. They don't store forever. So, even if nothing else changed, there's still an upper limit. It isn't exactly tiny, you can reasonably expect a decade or so of shelf life, but that limit is there, and the longer the device has been out, the less likely you'll be able to find replacements. I have an lgg3 and it's getting very difficult to find *new* batteries, that haven't been on a shelf for years themselves.

It's also getting to where apps can't update. I had to give it up because my carrier simply refused to let people keep using older devices.

So, you've got limits.

That being said, if you pick a fairly recent assortment that you can still find batteries for, that aren't next to impossible to switch batteries in, and aren't likely to be forced into obsolescence by carrier action, you'll get several years along by your plan. Probably close to a decade at the outside, with the later ones having less realistic use time by the time you start using them.

1129,Samsung PickAnAndroidForMe,Reddit,"If you don't mind a smaller phone, my vote is Galaxy S10e. Small battery but battery life is actually fine because of all the missing features that would normally suck up battery - no 5G, no high refresh rate, no 1440p (but 1080p at this size is like 1440p at 7""). And it's got Snapdragon 855 and is well under budget.

Second option is obviously the S10+, but I think the side fingerprint sensor on the S10e is probably better than the under-display sensor. Bigger screen and 1440p means battery life is probably near the S10e despite the bigger battery.

1215,Samsung SamsungGalaxy,Reddit,"So, I'm the inverse of you...I was a long-time iPhone user that switched to a Note 10+ in late 2019, and here's the obvious differences in my experience:

* With iOS there are fewer apps for core functionality because the Apple apps are so solid there's little reason for the average user to look for a 3rd party option.
* The integration between all the apps is so smooth...it's like a single, unified ecosystem with similar looks and behaviours.
* Security in general is likely superior, but I think Samsung Knox is locked down better than iOS.  From recent security reports I've come across, Android on most devices from the big players may be less susceptible from attack than iOS simply because if you code an exploit for iOS you only have to code it once, where on Android, it's one for Samsung and it's many unique implements, one for One+ and it's many unique implementations, etc...

You'll find that iOS isn't a topic of conversation among it's users....it just works and there's little to be done.   From day one, it has all the apps you'd want in a phone and there's no need to replace the Apple apps with anything else.

1241,Samsung SamsungGalaxy,Reddit,"Did you play in Wifi or mobile data? Did you play under a fan/Ac ? Did you play with default rendering distance? What was the brightness level? 

The latest Mali GPU is not great yet. Maybe Next One will be better since it will be built on New Arm v9 Architecture. Also Samsung didn't improve the cooling system inside the phone compared to S20 Ultra (Exynos 990), maybe they would have thought that since we have the changed the CPU, it should be efficient and provide less heat compared to previous one & they failed in that and another reason for not improving cooling system would be their competitor ""A"" since they don't use it and try to control the heat using software, Samsung would have thought they can do the same(only in future updates we will know that). Also to note that TSMC Chip is little power efficient than Samsung Chips(don't know the exact percentage), but there is a good news for future- a University has made a chip with cooling system and also the news says some big tech company has purchased it and it could be Samsung, since they got the name of ""Heat King for their Exynos chips"". 

This is could be the solution for you, remember any heavy games - pc games that are ran on smartphone would lead to heat the phone. Snapdragon would be able to play for little long than Exynos @50¬∞ and could give you btw 55fps~60fps. Exynos would start to give up as soon as the heat start to increasing but in ur case I'm bit surprised 52fps @50¬∞.
But im sure that if you play in cooler environment the exynos won't give up and also that's the basic rule too, that's the reason I asked you few questions in the beginning. If you are playing Minecraft, Genshin Impact And Fortnite + other heavy games, you definitely need an external cooling system so either get a small size table fan with powerful motor or get cooling fan from Blackshark. (Or) if you don't want spend more at least play with correct phone settings, under a ceiling fan/ Ac and try avoid charging. I play in older Exynos 9810 under a ceiling fan with correct settings, if I had the table fan or cooling fan, I think the fps will become more stable.",2021-06-25T21:11:16,,2,,negative

Apple Pros: 
- incredible integration with other apple products, such as airpods or apple watch.
- better controlled app store, which leads to less malware infested apps.
- iMessage is incredible
- iPhones have way faster chips than there android equivalents
- updates will come faster due to it being 1 version of the OS, instead of each phone company having to push the update themselves

Samsung Pros:
- better integration with Windows
- better integration with Google apps
- more customization (launchers, apps, etc.)
- USB C, for better compatibility with other devices chargers (most devices are switching to the USB C standard)
- if you do decide eventually that you want to switch to iPhone, it is easier to switch to an iPhone than off of one
- a better native file management app
- if you switch to another android device, it is super simple to setup

1290,Samsung Smartphones,Reddit,"Yes. I do think it is a good choice for a lot of people. 

However, I couldn't do it. I typically switch between iOS and Android every time I get a new phone. I got the iPhone 13 Pro on launch day, but I returned it at the end of my 2 week return period. 

I was coming from the Pixel 4XL and ended up going with the Pixel 6.

I recently typed out a long list of things I liked and things I didn't like, so I'll post it here to give you more information to help you make your decision.

* The animations make the OS feel slow. Which is ridiculous because the chip is powerful as fuck.

* Navigation is inconsistent. The back gesture isn't universal and you still have to reach to the top of the screen to go back in many places. It's not friendly for one handed navigation. 

* Even the smallest text size is atrociously big. It makes me feel like I'm using a phone designed for old people. I can read display about twice as much content (text messages, web browser, reddit comments, etc.) on my Pixel 6.

* The keyboard is severely lacking in features compared to Gboard on Android. There's a ton of wasted space at the bottom, you don't get the paste button in the prediction bar, and voice text is ass compared to Google's. 

* Siri is so much less useful than Google Assistant.

* The OS feels like it's designed for the mini and nothing scales to the phone, it's just made bigger to fill the screen.

* LastPass integration takes too many steps.

* Notification menu takes up the whole screen and doesn't organize things as well.

* Control Center has fewer helpful options. 

* Long press context menus are underutilized and have less features.

* Autofill worked in way fewer places.

* CarPlay feels dated compared to modern Android Auto.

* What shocked me most, was stability. I had more random app crashes in 2 weeks with the 13 Pro than I have in months of using a Pixel device. Even I bought into the myth that iPhones ""just work.""

The things that I liked better were:

* Apple Pay > Google Pay

* shortcuts is awesome

* Video recording

* Screenshot system is better (especially for video and scrolling screenshots)

* iMessages > Messages, but most of the people I talk to use Signal anyway so we wouldn't exclude Android users from features

* Apple Arcade is really good

* General build quality

* Wifi password sharing

* Airdrop is easier to use than Nearby share and it's a bit faster

* Facetime is better than Duo, but I only really do video calls via Teams anyway

Pixel /Android features that would be nice on iOS

* Call Screening

* AI call hold

* Split screen

* Magic Eraser

* Always on display

* Night Sight

* Now Playing

* Live Caption

* Set default apps

* USB-C

* AdBlock

* Emulators

It's so weird. I LOVE iPadOS. I don't get why iOS feels like it's 5 years behind

I don't feel slow navigating my iPad, but it took so many more gestures, swipes, or taps to get things done on my iPhone compared to my Pixel.

I just wish Apple would stop intentionally sabatoging 3rd party apps to force people into using their alternatives (iMessages, Safari, Keychain, and Keyboard come to mind) and thinking they suck compared to Apple's offerings when Apple is the one causing the problems.

iPhone 13 Pro Max will give you the best battery life and 7 years of support

Samsung will give you good battery life and 4 years of support

Pixel will give you decent battery life and 5 years of support

I'll be interested to hear how you balance these features, specs, and support.

1295,Samsung PickAnAndroidForMe,Reddit,"I don't think there are physically removable batteries anymore, but if you're planning to upgrade then pretty much any phone from the note 4 us a good upgrade. Since you're already used to Samsung, I'd recommend you to go with the S21U(money no object) or the S20FE 5G(great battery, nice cameras, on the smaller side when it comes to size of today's phones and it will be supported by samsung at least for 3 more years). The headphone jack is a tough one to find these days but the S20FE comes with microsd support, which is good. If you absolutely want the headphone jack, then the A52S from samsung is also good but since it has a slower processor, it is going to be obsolete much faster than the s-series of Samsung phones( i.e. the S20FE in this case). It also has 5G, which is a good thing.

As for the physical buttons, I'm not sure if you can get buttons on any phone from the past 3 years which will be good for you in the long run.

1320,Samsung PickAnAndroidForMe,Reddit,"I am a huge advocate for getting used phones, especially 2-3 year old flagships. I see a lot of people with expensive phones that are way more than what they really need, but on the other hand, I see people with cheap phones that they hate.

Now that said, I am from the US and my perspectives and recommendations are usually based around US phone prices, availability, and viability. I don't think you're from the US so I have no idea what kind of prices you're working with. I will say, I still tend to lean towards used flagships anyway, but I doubt the Note9 has a ""good price for the specs"".

At least here in the US, Samsung phones tend to be a bit more expensive for the specs, and the Notes tend to be a bit less ""value"" than the S series. To me, the Note9 is a ""niche"" phone. It's the last Galaxy Note with a headphone jack, so if you're looking for something with a stylus and it HAS to have a headphone jack, this is the phone I recommend. Otherwise, save some money and get an S9+ or spend the extra money to upgrade to something like an S10e. Or, of course, look at other companies.

Now you, of course, are apparently NOT in the US, but if eBay is still an option, I still think buying used flagships is a viable option. However, pricing varies from place to place. Here, in the US, the Pixels are very cheap. Outside of the US, they may be at a premium. It really depends.",2021-07-21T12:18:45,,2,,negative

Well, more accurately I moved from the S10+ to the Zflip 3 to the S10+ to the S22U after I broke my Zflip 3. 

When I moved from the s10+ to the zflip 3 I was still totally happy with my S10+. It was still snappy and the battery was great. I thought I'd hold onto it forever or at least until the battery got bad. But I got a great deal on a z flip 3 by trading in an old S8+ so I made the move. The z flip 3 was a side grade in every practical way but it was very cool. But it's battery was pretty bad, especially next to the S10+. Anyway, my z flip 3 broke and I had to use the S10+ again and honestly it was fine. 

Then I saw a great trade in deal for cracked screens so I figured I'd trade in the z flip 3 while the trade in value was still good. So I did it. I now use an S22U and I still have my S10+

1427,Samsung SamsungGalaxy,Reddit,"Update: I did more research and figured out I may have been in some sort of reboot loop. I read an article which said I should put it into recovery mode and then ""wipe cache partition"". I did this and it seemed to have fixed the issue temporarily - i got to my lock screen and it said 4% and fast charging, which is progress. But it still ended up dying and then falling into this cycle again. My new hope is that I leave it plugged in while in recovery mode (which seems to work fine) and then when I have enough battery hopefully I can at least backup those voice memos I have stored before trying a factory wipe. And if that doesn't work, I guess my phone finally died on me, and so suddenly :(   

Update 2: Leaving it plugged in recovery mode did nothing. I'm in the process of using odin to flash the firmware on my device using this tutorial https://youtu.be/xuV5-v91IUA. I read elsewhere that for some people this fixed the issue entirely - we'll find out. I also saw elsewhere that placing it on the wireless charger as well as plugging it in got the phone to charge (as the bootloop may occur due to some battery issue). I tried this and it managed to make my phone admit that it's at 0% and the LED is now red (charging). I've yet to follow up on this to see if it'll charge enough for me to back up my voice memos. The download time for my firmware is 3 hours so I'll update once that's figured out.   

Update 3: I didn't get around to flashing the firmware via odin - I'm not totally sure how, but I tried wiping the cache via recovery mode and then rebooting from that same menu again, and this time it managed to work - for now. My phone is charging seemingly normally and I'm taking this opportunity to backup my precious voice memos onto my computer and then google drive (for some reason samsung cloud backup isn't working for them). I still intend to get a new phone as I figure it's only a matter of time when this bullshit will happen again.    

To anyone reading this going thru the same shit - I wish you luck as I'm pretty sure luck was my saving grace this time. Maybe double charging it like I mentioned above also helped but I can't say for sure.

There are both 4G and 5G versions of the note 20 and note 20 ultra, so I‚Äôll just stick the ultra 5G on the comparison, but they‚Äôve all got the same processor in whatever region you‚Äôre in

https://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?idPhone1=10261&idPhone2=10596&idPhone3=11251

I do have an old note 3 here from a friend for trade in if need be to try, but I didn‚Äôt use older flagship galaxy phones myself.

Which region are you in? Flagship phones get snapdragon processors in north america & China, and Samsung exynos everywhere else (with some odd exceptions). China has good network band compatibility with Europe and the better snapdragon version is often cheaper to import. 

1. You mean like one the google street view app? I‚Äôm fairly sure you can take photo spheres in street view and save to gallery https://support.google.com/maps/answer/7012050?hl=en-GB.   There‚Äôs also a photo sphere function if you find a GCam port (usually better supported on snapdragon models). There‚Äôs a regular panorama mode on the stock camera app

2. That seems to be a thing you put together with your photo spheres like https://arvr.google.com/tourcreator/ Or https://www.vaned.com/blog/360-vr-real-estate-tours/

3. I‚Äôm fairly sure you do your handwritten notes on the Samsung notes app, but you could always get free dedicated apps like OneNote and Autodesk sketchbook

4. Mid range up to flagship Samsung phones always have OLED screens, yes. Note 20 (non ultra) has a plastic back, note 20 ultra has a glass back and stainless steel frame, S ultra models have a glass back and aluminium frame.

I personally think the note/ultra models are pretty overpriced, but I‚Äôm more of a base model kind of person (I have an iPad and pencil and S tab + pen and prefer a small phone). But if you want to use the S pen on a phone, those are the models that can use the pen

I can leave a laundry list of reasons if you want from my personal experience and from my girls experience. 

My brother has the s21 ultra and it's really good. The s22 ultra has upgrades in the boxier screen (if you prefer that), much much better cameras especially in HDR and night conditions, a brighter screen (matters to me since I'm outside a lot), and the s pen if you consider that an upgrade. The s22 ultra also feels a lot smoother than my brothers s21 ultra despite both of us running on the same software update. My brothers s21 ultra also gets warm and sometimes hot when he's recording videos or playing games, especially when we're outside. Aside from that, they're basically the same. 

I'd say since Samsung cucked us and got rid of the SD card slot, 512gb is better. If you're gonna record or take pictures, you're gonna seriously need the extra space. Videos and movies and songs are obviously situational on your end. Also the system files with the 512gb version isn't as compressed meaning theoretically, things should actually load a bit faster systemwide since the files have more space and don't have to be as compressed.

So basically I 100% recommend the 512gb variant of the phone but the s21 ultra vs s22 is purely up to you. If you have any questions at all, let me know",2022-05-11T19:42:47,,2,,negative

It really depends on what are your priorities for your phone. If you use your phone to game, poco f3 has better value and performs as well as Samsung's flagships. 

Samsung's software and cameras are usually better, but their phones might be marked up more. 

For low end/mid range phones you've gotta choose between cameras or cameras. If you want performance just go poco f3 or something with a snapdragon 800 series or mediatek dimensity 8000/9000.

If you want cameras maybe something like redmi note 10/11pro or a51/52/53 5g or something like that.

Batteries. They don't store forever. So, even if nothing else changed, there's still an upper limit. It isn't exactly tiny, you can reasonably expect a decade or so of shelf life, but that limit is there, and the longer the device has been out, the less likely you'll be able to find replacements. I have an lgg3 and it's getting very difficult to find *new* batteries, that haven't been on a shelf for years themselves.

It's also getting to where apps can't update. I had to give it up because my carrier simply refused to let people keep using older devices.

So, you've got limits.

That being said, if you pick a fairly recent assortment that you can still find batteries for, that aren't next to impossible to switch batteries in, and aren't likely to be forced into obsolescence by carrier action, you'll get several years along by your plan. Probably close to a decade at the outside, with the later ones having less realistic use time by the time you start using them.

There are so many issues and bugs with their software that the overall experience is shitty. For Android just go with Samsung. They've great software support and good customer support and they have great trade in deals (at least in the US). So investing in Samsung's ecosystem is worth it IMHO.

1525,Samsung PickAnAndroidForMe,Reddit,"Samsung is one of the, if not the most customizable version of android in many ways.. haven't tested sideloading yet and not entirely sure of what you mean by ""offload,"" but if you're talking about apps that can't be deleted, it is the standard google apps and Samsung's suite of apps.. they come neatly organized into their own folders. Not too big of nuisance really.

imo Samsung's one ui is for the maximalist in a sense. It has a lot of added features and capabilities other versions of android don't have, but to some, the experience can feel bloated.

I recently just switched from a OnePlus device, which is more of a stock android experience, and am super happy with Samsung's Software and I was super hesitant to switch to it because of the software specifically, but its actually super smooth and fast for the most part with a ton of customizability.

A cool feature I recommend you check out is Samsung's dex, especially if you like a windows like experience.

A more stock android experience like the Pixel or OnePlus may be an easier transition from Apple, but if you're really looking for a change, Samsung may be a better fit.

In my opinion, the S22U just feels way more like some kind of ultrapowerful entertainment device or multimedia device for both creating and consuming content.

I placed the order and got confirmation email for 22nd of May for delivery. I didn't think of it much as i had other things on my mind at that time. I get an email on 3rd of may that they have started to customize my device and i can expect it to arrive in 3 weeks time. 

It looks like its on track for May 22nd so far. But i am honestly considering of cancelling the order. I didn't buy samsung due to brand loyalty, I loved the s-pen feature and use it a lot. My current note 9 has major battery issues for whole of past 7-8 months. I get at most 3-4 hours and hence me ordering a new phone.

1631,Samsung SamsungGalaxy,Reddit,"Update: I did more research and figured out I may have been in some sort of reboot loop. I read an article which said I should put it into recovery mode and then ""wipe cache partition"". I did this and it seemed to have fixed the issue temporarily - i got to my lock screen and it said 4% and fast charging, which is progress. But it still ended up dying and then falling into this cycle again. My new hope is that I leave it plugged in while in recovery mode (which seems to work fine) and then when I have enough battery hopefully I can at least backup those voice memos I have stored before trying a factory wipe. And if that doesn't work, I guess my phone finally died on me, and so suddenly :(   

Update 2: Leaving it plugged in recovery mode did nothing. I'm in the process of using odin to flash the firmware on my device using this tutorial https://youtu.be/xuV5-v91IUA. I read elsewhere that for some people this fixed the issue entirely - we'll find out. I also saw elsewhere that placing it on the wireless charger as well as plugging it in got the phone to charge (as the bootloop may occur due to some battery issue). I tried this and it managed to make my phone admit that it's at 0% and the LED is now red (charging). I've yet to follow up on this to see if it'll charge enough for me to back up my voice memos. The download time for my firmware is 3 hours so I'll update once that's figured out.   

Update 3: I didn't get around to flashing the firmware via odin - I'm not totally sure how, but I tried wiping the cache via recovery mode and then rebooting from that same menu again, and this time it managed to work - for now. My phone is charging seemingly normally and I'm taking this opportunity to backup my precious voice memos onto my computer and then google drive (for some reason samsung cloud backup isn't working for them). I still intend to get a new phone as I figure it's only a matter of time when this bullshit will happen again.    

To anyone reading this going thru the same shit - I wish you luck as I'm pretty sure luck was my saving grace this time. Maybe double charging it like I mentioned above also helped but I can't say for sure.

Here‚Äôs a screen on time post for S21 https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS21/comments/neiqzv/whats_your_screenontime/

S21 FE might be a good option with 4500mAh, the same as the S22+. The S21+ has 4800mAh on gsmarena but it‚Äôs also the biggest of the three.

It seems the processors have been getting less efficient since the S20.

I assume you get the snapdragon model, in the YouTube tests I saw, the exynos version battery lasted longer (though seems everybody is only testing the ultras).

When I tried both base S21 versions, the exynos got the slightest bit better standby time. The trade off is that the last few snapdragon models have had better image/video quality than exynos version, especially in low light.

I‚Äôve switched between Samsung phones and iPhones as well, I don‚Äôt have a strong preference for either. I‚Äôm personally waiting to see what the new SE battery is doing cause I like smaller home button phones.

1640,Samsung SamsungGalaxy,Reddit,"I bought an A53 256GB recently.

The main argument against an A53 over an A52s is its slower CPU. 

My previous phone is a Xiaomi Mi9t pro - which had the top of the line Snapdragon of 3 years ago. SD855 or something.
So my old phone actually still made great photos, was still fast enough. But it does not receive any updates anymore. For over a year. 

As an ex Google Nexus owner, updates are something I *want* to have.

So I selected the newer A53 with its promised 4+1 year support over the already released, slightly faster and way cheaper A52s which has shorter support and is already a year or so into its lifespan.

Then urprise: While the A53 is not the fastest phone on the planet and not even in its price range, it performs solid!

Single core benchmark is slightly faster than my previous phone (SD855, mind), multicore it is slower, but you do not realize this outside of games or video encoding.

Photos are nice, too and Samsung is one of the few that do have a nice wide-angle lens in their mid class phones.

The fingerprint sensor is also not the fastest, but it is at least as good as the one on my Mi 9t pro. 

So for me, the A53 is a keeper!
I would not (yet) recommend an upgrade from an A52 or 52s to it, skip another generation.

One thing that was a little disappointing to me is the phones weight. Despite having a plastic back and an only very thinly metalized frame, it is just as heavy as my all glass and metal Mi 9t pro.",2022-05-01T10:38:17,,2,,negative

Xiaomi/poco is worth buying if you're willing to spend more and get something like a poco f3, or redmi note 10/11pro.

It really depends on what are your priorities for your phone. If you use your phone to game, poco f3 has better value and performs as well as Samsung's flagships. 

Samsung's software and cameras are usually better, but their phones might be marked up more. 

For low end/mid range phones you've gotta choose between cameras or cameras. If you want performance just go poco f3 or something with a snapdragon 800 series or mediatek dimensity 8000/9000.

If you want cameras maybe something like redmi note 10/11pro or a51/52/53 5g or something like that.

I know many people like one UI, but I know for sure most people find oxygen OS to be better (even after the oppo merge). 

I must however say that I had the s20fe 5g for 5 days but I sent it back. It had some dealbreaking bugs. The first one I encountered is a widely known one which is touchscreen issues. Sometimes it would not register touches in certain areas where other areas would work. It disappears in a few minutes and I had the issues around 7 times a day I think. 

Then there was another issue. The screen sometimes randomly went black. The only thing you could do to get the screen working was to connect it to a computer or outlet and then hold 2 buttons. Normal reset didn't even work. The phone was functioning because I received notifications, but the screen would show nothing, just black. This happened twice in my 5 days of having the phone. 

Because of these reasons I sent it back. It isn't to say that the same would happen to you, but know these issues exist. I traded it in for a Xiaomi Poco f3 and got ‚Ç¨200 back because it's cheaper. Had been a pleasure for more than half a year now.

Can I get a TV that is just a TV, please?

I have other devices that I can interchange (consoles, chrome cast, etc.), does everything the smart side of a Smart TV does, and easily stay up to date. I just need a display that will function, and not potentially brick itself little by little, all because a couple apps are no longer updated, or hasn't been able to check for an update for X period. Thanks!

I've got a couple smart TVs, granted no Samsung, both of which lasted maybe three years before apps like Netflix or Hulu stopped working, all because the apps can't update anymore.

A client of my IT Shop bought a Smart TV, older lady who was retired, and couldn't use the TV until it had reached out to the internet for an update. Funny thing, she didn't have internet, had no need. The local Walmart didn't have any non-smart TVs. To my knowledge, this is the only smart TV I've touched that required the internet. Thankfully, after the update through a hotspot (my cell), was able to disable the update function (otherwise nagged every half hour due to no internet), and she was able to watch satellite and DVDs normally. I can only suspect a factory reset, accidental or otherwise, will require internet again during setup.

I'm not necessarily that old, early 30s, I can see *some* use cases for NFTs, but most I see talked about, are just flashy and stupid.

The commission sees Apple's limitation as opposed to rivalry rules. On May 2, 2022, the Guardian reports that opposition chief Margrethe Vestager grumbled that Apple has ""mishandled its predominant position"" by not permitting adversaries to get to the NFC innovation in its gadgets.

As indicated by the commission, because of Apple's shut stage, ""a few designers didn't proceed with their arrangements \[to make versatile wallets\] as they couldn't arrive at iPhone clients.""

Vestagern added: ""By barring others from the game, Apple has unjustifiably protected its Apple Pay wallet. Whenever demonstrated, this conduct would add up to maltreatment of a predominant position, which is unlawful.""

Apple has recently asserted that permitting rival patent frameworks to approach the NFC innovation in the iPhone would be inconvenient to ease of use, information assurance, and the security of clients' monetary data. On the off chance that it can demonstrate that it locked NFC to Apple Pay just for the sake of security, there is plausible that the organization will keep away from discipline.

Nonetheless, in the event that Apple is viewed as blameworthy, it could confront fines of up to 10% of its worldwide income, which in light of the $365bn income in 2021 could be just about as much as $36.5bn.

1773,Samsung Samsung,Reddit,"I'm gonna try to explain this in a more creative way. There are two companies which build cars and are in direct rivalry.

* Company A has 5 models available ranging from 10,000$ for the cheapest and 100,000$ for the most expensive model. All those models have different engine types and used different fuel types. The models were varied as well. A sedan, an SUV, a hatchback, a roadster and a supercar.
 
* Company B has 2 models available ranging from 40,000$ to 90,000$. Both are electric cars with almost the same engine power. One is a Hatachback, the other is a Sedan. The sedan offers some better features but both cars feel almost the same in driving and feature set.

Now consider that Company A had to spend at least 2-3x the R&D of Company B to come up with all the engine models, to try and make every one of their models comfortable, useful and attractive to customers.

Company B had to spend a significant amount of money on developing their hatchback car. And they had a lot of time and budget on their hands. So their hatchback feels almost as good as Company A's SUV. After finishing their hatchback, they are now adapting that hatchback to a sedan. They spend some R&D money on the development of that Sedan and they make it better but not by a mile. It just feel like a better product but it's in fact just a hatchback with better road stability and the same interior design and it can even last more on the road because of the extra space the batteries have.

And now, both companies announce that 3rd party developers can create accessories for these cars.

* Company A offers moderate help for implementation and is not all that strict when it comes to said implementations.
 
* Company B offers more assistance for implementation than company A does however, it's more strict when it comes to said implementations.


As a 3rd party company that creates accessories, you have 2 options. Go with company A which has more models available but it's not selling as well as company B? Or go with Company B, save some money while making more profit and have only 2 vehicles to work with? Which are already largely similar. So it may just be slight tweaks to create the same accessories for the second vehicle.

I may have gone a little too long. However, I hope you understand that this is virtually how app optimizations work right now. Imagine if you were Snapchat or Instagram and you had to optimize your app for 15 phone models vs having to optimize for over 15,000 phone models. That's the direct comparison of iOS and Android. Nobody would want to optimize for 15,000 phone models. You'd lose a ton of money and not get who knows what out of it.

That's why Samsung just now managed to bring camera optimizations for only 3 apps. Snapchat, Instagram and Tiktok. And these optimizations are strictly for S22 series. However, with the S22 series being multi regional, it's still 6 unique phone models.

And we're not talking about app performance, we're talking about camera performance in those apps. I hope we'll see more major companies optimizing for the S22 series. But with how long it took... this is just wishful thinking, honestly.

**TL;DR**: It's extremely complicated and expensive to optimize apps for so many phone models. It's much easier to do it for the company that has a handful of phone models and sells a ton of phones than for companies that have a fuckton of phone models and sell almost as much as the other company.",2022-05-07T08:59:31,,84,,negative

1778,Samsung Samsung,Reddit,">Samsung has already removed that pesky headphone jack and liberated us from high fidelity universally available headphones in favor of more expensive lower fidelity buds.

I prefer bluetooth headphones and never really used the headphone jack.

>Thankfully they also removed the SD card as well so we can rely on the cloud for all things. That's what 5G is for amirite? 128gb should be enough, maybe they could remove some even.

This one pisses me off a little but to be honest, I only ever use about 50 or 60 GB of my phone's internal storage anyway, and most of that is audio books that get rotated out as I listen to them. So...128gb is enough for me.

>Removable batteries was a fantastic removal as well. Power banks don't require a phone restart, so what if they're heavy, chonky, and slow.

From a repair standpoint, I agree, removable batteries should be a thing. From a usability standpoint though, my S21+ gets two days of battery on a full charge per my usage, and the phone charges so fast that I'm not sure I'd carry a power bank anyway. Again, this might be a bonus of my use-case.

>IR blasters make us use our devices more. I prefer the minimalism that's granted by removing this feature. I just need to also have TV remotes handy for every TV in my house since I can't just use my phone. Hope they still have good batteries!

Gonna be honest, I didn't even know phones had IR blasters until I watched a Flossy Carter phone review and he mentioned it. I don't watch TV though, so maybe that's why I wouldn't have noticed.

>The power brick was literally destroying the environment! I'm glad Samsung is so conscious! I mean I know it's more packing and worse for the environment for people that buy a charger for their $1000+ phones, but that's their fault for not already having chargers!

This is the one thing you bring up that really affects me. It's idiotic to sell an electrical device and not include a way to charge the fucking thing. 

As for the rest, I'm not trying to argue with you or shoot down your complaints...I'm just pointing out that for the ""average"" phone user, I think most of that stuff doesn't matter. They don't really carry heavy files on their phones to need storage, bluetooth headphones are far more convenient than wired, especially if you're on the go and you don't really care about ""high-fidelity"" sound, and by the time most peoples' batteries go bad they've bought a new phone anyway.

1828,Samsung SamsungGalaxy,Reddit,"Update: I did more research and figured out I may have been in some sort of reboot loop. I read an article which said I should put it into recovery mode and then ""wipe cache partition"". I did this and it seemed to have fixed the issue temporarily - i got to my lock screen and it said 4% and fast charging, which is progress. But it still ended up dying and then falling into this cycle again. My new hope is that I leave it plugged in while in recovery mode (which seems to work fine) and then when I have enough battery hopefully I can at least backup those voice memos I have stored before trying a factory wipe. And if that doesn't work, I guess my phone finally died on me, and so suddenly :(   

Update 2: Leaving it plugged in recovery mode did nothing. I'm in the process of using odin to flash the firmware on my device using this tutorial https://youtu.be/xuV5-v91IUA. I read elsewhere that for some people this fixed the issue entirely - we'll find out. I also saw elsewhere that placing it on the wireless charger as well as plugging it in got the phone to charge (as the bootloop may occur due to some battery issue). I tried this and it managed to make my phone admit that it's at 0% and the LED is now red (charging). I've yet to follow up on this to see if it'll charge enough for me to back up my voice memos. The download time for my firmware is 3 hours so I'll update once that's figured out.   

Update 3: I didn't get around to flashing the firmware via odin - I'm not totally sure how, but I tried wiping the cache via recovery mode and then rebooting from that same menu again, and this time it managed to work - for now. My phone is charging seemingly normally and I'm taking this opportunity to backup my precious voice memos onto my computer and then google drive (for some reason samsung cloud backup isn't working for them). I still intend to get a new phone as I figure it's only a matter of time when this bullshit will happen again.    

To anyone reading this going thru the same shit - I wish you luck as I'm pretty sure luck was my saving grace this time. Maybe double charging it like I mentioned above also helped but I can't say for sure.

A 9mm bullet weighs about 8 grams but you wouldn't be surprised if it destroyed your phone.
