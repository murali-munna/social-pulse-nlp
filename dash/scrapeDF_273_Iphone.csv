1065,Apple iphone 14,Reddit,"This happens WAY more often than gets reported. Especially with Apple, they negotiate so hard that the vendors are operating on razor thin margins during development on the promise that they‚Äôll make it back once production picks up. As a result, they push the limits a lot and will try to make ‚Äústealth‚Äù changes that reduce their costs without their customers noticing. When they do that with smaller companies they often don‚Äôt have the resources to fully vet every module/component, but with larger companies like Apple they usually get caught out. 

BOE won‚Äôt lose Apple‚Äôs business overall, but Apple will implement really strict requirements for the vendor. There aren‚Äôt enough display manufacturers who can maintain the supply and quality requirements that Apple demands, and BOE also is cheaper than Samsung Display  so they won‚Äôt want to drop BOE as an option entirely.

1082,Apple iphone 14,Reddit,"The reason is simple: These apps are built for content providers, not for end users.


This was the single biggest fear I had with Apple getting into the content business, and it‚Äôs coming to fruition. When you become a services company, you are financially incentivized to sell your services. You‚Äôre incentivized to put your content ahead of your end user experience.


That‚Äôs why the Music and TV apps feel like giant ads. Instead of providing you with tools to organize, arrange, and sift through your content, these apps are built like giant billboards, advertising the next movie and the next album that they want you to consume. It‚Äôs not about what you want to watch or listen to; it‚Äôs about what content *they want to push on you*.

They like to label this ‚Äúcuration‚Äù and pretend they‚Äôre doing you a favor, but in reality, it‚Äôs just advertising. ‚ÄúCuration‚Äù is just a way to try to get users okay with ads. Because make no mistake, these are ads.

Look at the Music app, for example. Of the 5 main tabs, 4 of them are trying to push content on you. ‚ÄòListen Now‚Äô, ‚ÄòBrowse‚Äô, and ‚ÄòRadio‚Äô are all examples of Apple saying ‚ÄúWe want you to consume this content‚Äù, and even the Search tab has become that way with its ‚ÄòBrowse By Category‚Äô tiles. The only tab that is actually user-focused is ‚ÄòLibrary‚Äô, and Apple has been half-assing that tab for years.

The Apple TV app is the same way. Maybe even worse.

It‚Äôs all about foisting content on you. It‚Äôs about content providers and about service revenue. Apple simply isn‚Äôt as user-focused as it used to be, and I find that incredibly disappointing for a company I like so much.",2021-07-17T10:43:11,,249,

2. Keep it declutter. Mine is the 32 gb version and when I have a lot of games, files and stuff in general it gets slow and behaves poorly. I storage almost everything in the cloud and use the iPad or Mac for heavy stuff.

- Kill Apple News
- Either kill the bedtime tracking in Health or vastly improve it, the tracking is essentially useless right now it's so dumb
- Improve the Tips app and make it front and centre for new users. You know all those same tips you always see posted and upvoted on Apple subs? That's what the Tips app should be. Use it to fix iOS's discoverability which is terrible right now which is why 3D Touch died
- Improve the Camera app performance, it's a clunky piece of shit that forces other apps out of RAM even on iPhone 11 to 13 (newest phones)
- Kill Apple News
- Improve organisation in Settings app, make more consistent with Mac
- Redo iPadOS multitasking. Just fucking redo it. And allow external video output ffs Apple
- Improve iCloud sync. Please. Yesterday I put a Twitter 2FA code into iCloud Passwords, clicked Save, an hour later, found out it hadn't saved. Used my 2FA backup code, a few hours later, forgot it hadn't saved, got locked out of my account. Yes this is partially user error as I should have got a new 2FA backup code after I realised it was broken, but I wouldn't have been in the situation in the first place if Apple made their syncing work properly
- On the same note, the new Safari tab groups is absolutely broken if you use it for anything slightly advanced, if you try to edit your groups or close/add tabs while its syncing (which is a completely background process and you won't know when it's happening), it will lose your pages completely and it'll sync blank tabs.
- Just fix Safari in general, it feels slow and clunky
- Allow third-party browsers to use their own engines. Chrome is still stuck with the bad Safari engine
- Improve Mac and iOS consistency like OP said, weird stuff in Mail, Calendar, Settings, etc. it's 2022
- Handoff is basically useless, they never improved it after iOS 8 in 2015. Why can't I Handoff music from phone to Mac? I actually very much enjoy the Apple Music app on iOS but the lack of Handoff is ridiculous at this point, people have been requesting it for almost ten years

1201,Apple Apple Phones,Reddit,"To further clarify: I have both the mini 5 and the 13 Pro Max. I love both--in fact, with Handoff, I'm achieving with these two devices a kind of dual-screened modularity I had not expected to compete, but somehow now is, against something like the Surface Duo. So this was not meant as a slight against the mini.

That said: if the Pro phones get Pencil support, that could serve as a hard differentiator that might allow the regular iPhones to get features like better cameras or ProMotion. Having the 13 Pro Max, I can also easily see good uses for the Pencil--e.g. Notability would be very usable in landscape mode, or with the 'zoomed' writing function. 

This also would seem to go with Apple's general approach of perfecting a technology with one product before letting it flow into other product lines. E.g. the M1 going from Macs to iPads; ProMotion going from iPads to Macs; mini LED; etc.",2022-05-13T17:51:04,,1,

It‚Äôs just so good that throwing money at incremental upgrades or developing display and in display Face ID technology seems a bit premature. 

My philosophy with Apple products is to get the last iteration of it rather than being at the bleeding edge with a higher probability of hardware issues. My M1 MacBook Air and M1 13 inch MacBook Pro are amazing, because the Ive-era form factor was fully fleshed out and could finally cool the machine correctly.

1349,Apple iphone 14,Reddit,"Whilst I agree that there might be a loss of function here; I totally disagree with most of the comments and reporting about what that actual function is.
As someone who has needed this feature for many years and has had it turned on since I was aware of it; I find it funny how people are noticing more noise on the line when the person they‚Äôre speaking to is on a 13‚Ä¶
This feature has no effect on the microphone. It has no effect on the noise sent down the call. And the explanation of what it does is partially in the description of the feature. It‚Äôs an active noise cancellation. You can feel the effect on your ear drum. It attempts to help reduce the background noise around you so you can hear the person talking on the phone. Doesn‚Äôt reduce their noise. Doesn‚Äôt stop the noise around you from going down the line (not saying nothing does, just this doesn‚Äôt)

And we know that having a microphone available for this doesn‚Äôt mean that the chipset to run the ANC is in the 13. 

I am not sure it‚Äôs a bug. I can‚Äôt see any evidence it‚Äôs a bug. The forums speculation isn‚Äôt evidence to me. It here could just as easily be a change in the chipset for 13 where some hardware for this is not available. 

But I‚Äôve been using this feature for years now to help with hearing the caller when I am in a noisy environment. Nothing to do with reducing noise from the caller. Nothing to do with CarPlay. Nothing to do with loudspeaker. Nothing to do with voice isolation. Nope, nah, no way, sorry. 

I appreciate I‚Äôll probably attract the for speaking out against the likes of 9to5 who have completely misreported on what the feature is, so I‚Äôll post a link from back before the iPhone 13 was alive to show you what it actually was about before the hysteria set in and people magically started noticing completely unrelated stuff to the feature being worse:

https://www.howtogeek.com/691911/how-to-disable-phone-noise-cancellation-on-iphone/

So I agree that a function is missing. 

I just totally disagree on what function is missing, as someone who‚Äôs relied upon it for half a decade or more.

1544,Apple iphone 14,Reddit,"This is awesome! My dad has hundreds of recipes he‚Äôs collected from magazines and newspapers for years, and I would LOVE to create a digital database of these recipes to preserve for years to come. 

I‚Äôve just bought one month, and tried scanning a few recipes. It works pretty well, but there are a few things that could be improved. 

1.	Multiple ingredient sections/scans. The app only lets you to do one scan for the ingredient section, but if there are multiple you‚Äôre left scanning one section and inputting the rest manually. The ability to scan multiple times into the ingredient section would be great. 
2.	Building on this, a lot of recipes have ‚Äòsub‚Äô recipes, and it would be cool to have an option to seperate these out. For example a lasagne recipe might have a bechamel sauce ingredients, and the tomato sauce ingredients. Having them as seperate ingredient sections (like they are often presented in books etc) would be really handy. 
3.	Steps! At the moment these seem to just pull out each line of a paragraph as a seperate step. This is probably quite tricky as publications use different formatting‚Ä¶ but defaulting to sentences not individual lines would be handy. See the screenshot below of how it‚Äôs grabbed a paragraph of text and just broken it up per line. 
4.	Merge steps. A quick method to grab steps together after the scan would be handy. I don‚Äôt need an individual step for ‚Äòcut the spinach‚Äô ‚Äòwash the spinach‚Äô ‚Äòadd spinach to the pan‚Äô (if it‚Äôs been written that way). Dragging one on top of another to merge the text would be really cool!

But I think the more practical answer to why this happens is that Apple wants to release reliable products. If they are unable to satisfactorily test stuff, then they may delay the feature. Also, sometimes even if the thing has been well tested - partners may not be able to ramp scale up to supply an iPhone, iPad, or MBP. It makes no sense for Apple to chain themselves to a boat anchor that is a supplier.

I mainly see the problem with the stainless steel frame, as you mentioned. They add durability but also increase the weight so much that the Pro Max phones end up heavier with less hardware than the android competition. I would pick an aluminum frame if I could.

I hope phones don't get that much heavier than right now, but please don't go back to bending iPhone 6's. I enjoy the massive sensors and periscope cameras, but I hope they can improve camera performance and battery life without adding too much weight in the future.

I didn‚Äôt know what to do so I left it on my desk. A little while later I charged the phone and a message appeared asking to call and return it if it was found. I called him and gave him back his iPhone. Poor man had it ripped out of his hands on the bus.

It doesn‚Äôt matter that I paid 600$ for it the iPhone didn‚Äôt belong to me. We met at a T-Mobile store and he was able to provide proof of ownership and it took 3 hours to get the phone removed from the black list.

1936,Apple iphone 14,Reddit,"I don't think so.  

I think this is a case of speculation based on someone finding out about one technology and thinking about how it could be applied on the iPhone.

QLC is an exciting new technology where the benefits in terms of Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) come mostly from space savings at data centers over HDDs, especially when dealing with write-few, read-many scenarios and where capacity is prioritized over speed and longevity over standard SSDs.

The problem with QLC is that the write-longevity is significantly shorter and the speed slower than conventional SSDs.  Although, I wonder how much of a factor longevity would be in relatively short-life iPhones without knowing if Apple has a supplier who has developed something better than what's available today (which also raises the supply issue to begin with).

The bigger reason I don't think Apple would do this is based on marketing.   At best (tech, supply, and cost issues aside) this falls into the ""just because they can, doesn't mean they will"" category.

At a maximum of 6GB per minute, you'd be getting \~2.5 hours of maximum video on a 1TB iPhone.  I'm sure there are *some* number of people who would find benefit of more storage than that, but Apple has had a long history of focusing on a larger profile of user and minimizing their SKUs.

Not that some people wouldn't want 2TB (or even more) and not that it isn't coming, but I don't see this happening with the next iPhone or even the one after that.",2021-10-01T11:34:23,,-1,

People tend to take very close care and use of their phone and/or watch, generally having it on their person nearly 24/7, being expensive items.  And generally they're password protected as well.  The future of keyless entries using facial recognition, biometrics, voice, etc. is rapidly approaching.  For a lot of businesses, it makes sense.  Mom 'n pop outfits, not so much.  When you deal with a lot of customers/employees and a lot of locks throughout a building, systems like these just make sense.
